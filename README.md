# Quiz
This program was inspired by an icebreaker quiz for CU planning days.
Each player privately gave answers to a set of questions (about themselves) beforehand, and when the answers were read out, players had to guess who gave each answer.
This program was designed to make it possible to answer the quiz questions with complete anonymity, so that all could play, seeing as no-one had to collect, and therefore know, the answers.
The file consists of 3 sections: 
1.An invitation to input the desired question fields for the quiz, along with how the results will later be presented for guessing
2.A survey environment, where each player gives a name, followed by an answer to each question
3.The game proper, where, each field taken in turn, the responses are given in random order, and each player allowed to guess
After each field is exhausted, correct answers are revealed and running (or final) scores are given
